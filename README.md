# Music Scores

A Repository containing files pertaining to the music that I create and/or arrange.

The repository mainly contains Lilypond files needed to generate the score, with the occasional PDF and/or LaTeX files that serve as further explanatory material.

## Structure

Each top-level folder in this repository contains files for a piece of music. 

_TODO_: Define a proper structure inside each of these folders
